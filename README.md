# 📊 Task-1: Population Age Distribution Visualization

## 📝 Overview
This project demonstrates how to use Python to create a **bar chart** (or histogram) that visualizes the **age distribution** in a population. The focus is on analyzing categorical age groups such as:
- 0–14 years
- 15–64 years
- 65+ years

It helps in demographic analysis and provides quick insights into the population structure.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** – for creating bar charts
- **NumPy** – numerical computations
- **Excel (.xlsx) Files** – source data

---

## 📂 Project Files
```
📄 age_distribution_visualization.py     # Main script to process and plot data
📊 population_data.xlsx                  # Excel file containing population age data
```

---

## 📈 What the Script Does

1. **Reads the Excel file** containing age-wise population data.
2. **Handles missing or null values** for cleaner analysis.
3. **Calculates basic statistics** such as median age per group.
4. **Creates a bar chart** representing age group distributions.
5. Displays the chart for visualization and interpretation.

## 🧠 Use Cases
- Demographic analysis for government or NGO projects
- Educational visualizations
- Health & policy planning
- Data journalism projects

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo or download the files  
2. Install dependencies (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib openpyxl
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python age_distribution_visualization.py
   ```

---

## 📌 Sample Output

The output is a bar chart that clearly shows the count or percentage of individuals in each age category.
